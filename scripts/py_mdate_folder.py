"""
In this script, I've chosen to use the os.path.getmtime() function. Please read this stackoverflow thread
that explains the difference between the two:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32010724/the-time-functions-time-getmtime-and-time-getctime-gives-the-same-result

To summarize:

os.path.getmtime() - Time when file *data* last modified.  Changed by the `mkdir`, `mkfifo`, `mknod`, `utimes`, `write` & system calls.

os.path.getctime() - Time when file *status* was last changed (inode data modification).  Changed by the `chflags`, `chmod`, `chown`,
                     `creat`, `link`, `mkdir`, `mkfifo`, `mknod`, `rename`, `rmdir`, `symlink`, `truncate`, `unlink`, `utimes`, 
                     `write` & `writev` system calls.
