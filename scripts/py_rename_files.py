    Parameters:
    ----------
    file_path : path to directory where files to be renamed are stored              : str : :
    name_path : path to directory where .csv file containing name mapping is stored : str : :
    name_csv  : name of the .csv file that contains the old-new name mapping        : str : :

    Description:
    ------------
    Reads the specified .csv file and renames files in the file_path based on the values in the .csv.

    The name of the .csv file does not matter, but it must have two columns called `old_name` and `new_name`.

    Returns:
    --------
    A log file in `/logs` with the date, time, and function name in the title of the file; prints confirmation.
