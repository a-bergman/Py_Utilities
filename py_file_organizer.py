## TO DO
# Figure out a system to deal with duplicate files

# Logs stored in: `C:/Users/andre/Documents/Logs/`

# Analyst should add their name in a similar format
analyst = "andrew.bergman"

"""
This script is currently (as of 9/05/2025) configured to handle files I happened to have on hand. The overall
idea is that this will need to be modified depending on the file is pasted in to. I.e. the analyst will need
to update/add/remove the file extensions, directory names, and the list of directories in lines 13 to 26 as
well as in `py_file_organizer()` itself.
